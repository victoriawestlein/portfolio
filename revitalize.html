        <p class="section-three-text">This website was created for a soda brand I thought of called ‘revitalize.’ It features recipe inspiration, rewards programs that users can join, and also showcases the different flavors that are available from the brand. The logo itself was made in Illustrator and the other components were made in Figma.</p>
